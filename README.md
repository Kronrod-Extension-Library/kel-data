Kronrod Extensions Library Basic Data
=====================================

This repository contains the basic lists which Kronrod Extensions exist for which polynomial.


Search for and list all rules
-----------------------------

The data in this repository can be generated by calling 'rekes' like:

```
for i in {1..50}; do echo $i; rekes $i 100 6 > "rules_n${i}_maxp50_maxrec5.txt"; done
```

assuming the `rekes` utility from the `kes` project is on the path.
A parallel version  using 16 cpu cores is:

```
seq 1 50 | parallel -j16 --will-cite 'rekes {} 50 5 > rules_n{}_maxp50_maxrec5.txt'
```

Compute rule data
-----------------

Compute the polynomials and nodes and weights for all rules
listed in the `rules_n*` files from above.

```
python3 rulecomputer.py rules_n*
```

Write data file
---------------

Extract the nodes and weights and write `csv` files:

````
for f in rule_*.txt; do echo $f; python extract_nw.py $f; done
````

Parallel version:

```
ls rule_*.txt | parallel -j16 --will-cite 'python extract_nw.py {}'
```

Plot the nodes and weights
--------------------------

```
for f in rule_*.txt; do echo $f; python plot_nw.py $f; done
```

Parallel version:

```
ls rule_*.txt | parallel -j16 --will-cite 'python plot_nw.py {}'
```
